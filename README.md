Shopping Cart
==============

This is a simple web page based on the media object which also demonstrates some simple capabilities of a web ordering page. 

The product list started out as static HTML. Now it is read in from an array where each product has more information associated with it. Thus the name for this project now has "Complex Data" :)

Click on the add button which triggers an event to the Javascript code to dynamically add the item to the cart.
